/**
 * The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the
 * entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource
 * identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.
 * 
 * Since by definition the actual function performed by POST is
 * determined by the server and often depends on the particular
 * resource, the behavior of POST when applied to collections cannot be
 * meaningfully modified because it is largely undefined.  Thus, the
 * semantics of POST are unmodified when applied to a collection.
